Durham School Navigator
=======================

Durham School Navigator is a website to help Durham, NC residents navigate the
`Durham Public School System`_. We found it difficult to find information about all the public schools - neighborhood, magnet and charter - and navigate the lottery and priority zoning rules. We This open source project is built and maintained by
`Code for Durham`_.

The official site is online at https://durhamschoolnavigator.org/. The code is
available on `GitHub`_. The `email list`_ is on Google Groups.

Are you a new parent or new to the area? Are you as confused as us by the Durham school zoning and the process for applying to charter or magnet schools? What are your kids' chances of going to the schools nearest your home? This application will provide parents who are looking to move to or within Durham a simple online interface to find out where your home sits within the different school zones, as well as give you relevant data for each school.  

Phase 2 (design phase): Incorporate key data points (e.g. score improvement rates, teacher/student ratios, school report cards) that will help parents choose a school path

Goal: Remove friction for understanding the local school system and improve on [existing DPS web tools](http://www.dpsnc.net/pages/Durham_Public_Schools/Our_Schools/Find_Your_School))

Target group: Parents or Prospective Parents seeking to understand how their residential choice will impact where their kids can go to school.
