Durham School Navigator
=======================

Durham School Navigator is a website to help Durham, NC residents navigate the
`Durham Public School System`_. We found it difficult to find information about all the public schools - neighborhood, magnet and charter - and navigate the lottery and priority zoning rules. This open source project is built and maintained by
`Code for Durham`_.

The official site is online at https://durhamschoolnavigator.org/ if you want to test out the latest or share with friends. The code is available on `GitHub`_ if you want to contribute. The `email list`_ is on Google Groups if you want to communicate and support us on this project.

So if you are a new parent or new to the area, or confused about which schools are the best fit, or your kids' chances of going to the schools nearest your home....and want to HELP DO something about it and make the system work better for all. JOIN US to make this application better to provide parents who are looking at moving to or within Durham with a simple online interface to find out where your home sits within the different school zones, as well as give you relevant data for each school.  

Phase 2 (design phase): Incorporate key data points (e.g. score improvement rates, teacher/student ratios, school report cards) that will help parents choose a school path

Project Goal: Remove friction for understanding the local school system and improve on 'existing DPS web tools'_.

Target group: Parents or Prospective Parents seeking to understand how their residential choice will impact where their kids can go to school.
